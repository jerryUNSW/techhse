MEDICAL TEXT ANONYMIZATION WITH TERMINOLOGY PRESERVATION:

CRITICAL MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- PRESERVE ALL MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY: Keep every medical term, diagnosis, symptom, treatment, and clinical detail
- MAINTAIN DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY: Ensure medical questions remain diagnostically meaningful
- REMOVE ONLY PII: Eliminate only personally identifiable information (names, ages, locations, dates)
- PRESERVE CLINICAL CONTEXT: Keep all medical reasoning, symptom relationships, and diagnostic pathways

MEDICAL TERMS TO NEVER CHANGE:
✅ Diagnoses: myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension, pneumonia, stroke, etc.
✅ Symptoms: chest pain, dyspnea, fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, etc.
✅ Treatments: surgery, medication, therapy, chemotherapy, radiation, etc.
✅ Anatomical: heart, lung, liver, brain, artery, vein, muscle, bone, etc.
✅ Procedures: laparoscopy, endoscopy, biopsy, imaging, surgery, etc.
✅ Measurements: blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, lab values, etc.
✅ Conditions: acute, chronic, severe, mild, bilateral, unilateral, etc.

ONLY TRANSFORM PII (Personally Identifiable Information):
✅ Patient names → "a patient", "an individual", "the patient"
✅ Specific ages → "middle-aged", "elderly", "young adult", "adolescent"
✅ Specific locations → "a medical facility", "a hospital", "a clinic"
✅ Exact dates → "recently", "previously", "at presentation", "during admission"
✅ Hospital names → "a medical center", "a healthcare facility"
✅ Doctor names → "the physician", "the doctor", "the attending"

MEDICAL ABSTRACTION EXAMPLES:

Original: "Dr. Smith, a 45-year-old cardiologist at General Hospital, diagnosed the patient with acute myocardial infarction on January 15th."

✅ CORRECT: "A middle-aged cardiologist at a medical facility diagnosed the patient with acute myocardial infarction recently."

❌ WRONG: "A healthcare professional diagnosed the patient with a heart condition recently."

Original: "The 65-year-old diabetic patient from Boston presented with chest pain radiating to the left arm."

✅ CORRECT: "The elderly diabetic patient from a location presented with chest pain radiating to the left arm."

❌ WRONG: "The elderly individual with a chronic condition experienced discomfort extending to the upper limb."

MEDICAL PRIVACY VALIDATION:
- Check each candidate for medical terminology preservation
- Ensure no medical terms were abstracted or generalized
- Verify only PII was removed, not medical facts
- Confirm diagnostic accuracy is maintained
- Validate clinical reasoning is preserved

TASK:
Original: {input_sentence}

Generate paraphrases that:
1. Remove ALL personally identifiable information (names, ages, locations, dates)
2. Preserve ALL medical terminology and clinical details
3. Maintain diagnostic accuracy and medical reasoning
4. Keep the question medically meaningful and diagnostically useful

Output ONLY the paraphrases, one per line, without any formatting or numbering.
