MEDICAL TEXT PRIVACY PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:

CRITICAL MEDICAL CONTEXT RULES:
1. MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY PRESERVATION: NEVER abstract or generalize medical terms, diagnoses, symptoms, treatments, or clinical procedures
2. DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY MAINTENANCE: Preserve all medical facts, clinical details, and diagnostic information
3. CLINICAL REASONING PROTECTION: Maintain medical logic, symptom relationships, and diagnostic pathways
4. ANATOMICAL PRECISION: Keep all anatomical terms, body parts, and physiological references

MEDICAL TERMS TO ALWAYS PRESERVE:
✅ Medical diagnoses: myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension, pneumonia, etc.
✅ Symptoms: chest pain, dyspnea, fever, nausea, vomiting, etc.
✅ Treatments: surgery, medication, therapy, procedures, etc.
✅ Anatomical terms: heart, lung, liver, brain, artery, vein, etc.
✅ Clinical procedures: surgery, biopsy, imaging, tests, etc.
✅ Medical measurements: blood pressure, temperature, lab values, etc.
✅ Medical conditions: acute, chronic, severe, mild, etc.

MEDICAL PRIVACY TRANSFORMATIONS (ONLY for PII):
✅ Patient names → "a patient", "an individual", "the patient"
✅ Specific ages → "middle-aged", "elderly", "young adult", "adolescent"
✅ Specific locations → "a medical facility", "a hospital", "a clinic"
✅ Exact dates → "recently", "previously", "at presentation", "during admission"
✅ Hospital names → "a medical center", "a healthcare facility"
✅ Doctor names → "the physician", "the doctor", "the attending"

FORBIDDEN MEDICAL ABSTRACTIONS:
❌ "heart condition" instead of "myocardial infarction"
❌ "breathing problems" instead of "dyspnea"
❌ "high blood pressure" instead of "hypertension"
❌ "chest discomfort" instead of "chest pain"
❌ "surgical procedure" instead of "laparoscopic cholecystectomy"
❌ "blood vessel" instead of "coronary artery"

MEDICAL CONTEXT EXAMPLES:

Original: "A 45-year-old diabetic patient presents with acute myocardial infarction with ST-elevation, chest pain radiating to the left arm, and diaphoresis."

✅ CORRECT: "A middle-aged diabetic patient presents with acute myocardial infarction with ST-elevation, chest pain radiating to the left arm, and diaphoresis."

❌ WRONG: "A middle-aged individual with a chronic condition experiences a heart condition with elevated readings, discomfort extending to the upper limb, and excessive sweating."

Original: "During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the cystic artery is inadvertently transected, leading to significant bleeding."

✅ CORRECT: "During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the cystic artery is inadvertently transected, leading to significant bleeding."

❌ WRONG: "During a surgical procedure, a blood vessel is accidentally cut, causing substantial blood loss."

MEDICAL PRIVACY SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All medical terminology preserved exactly
- All clinical details maintained
- All diagnostic information intact
- Only PII (names, ages, locations, dates) removed
- Medical reasoning and logic preserved
- Question diagnostic accuracy maintained
