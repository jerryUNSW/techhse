Generate 10 DIVERSE paraphrases of the following question with VARYING levels of generalization.
CRITICAL: Create a mix of candidates - some with moderate generalization, some with high generalization.
Each paraphrase must be significantly different from the others and MEANINGFUL.

### GENERALIZATION STRATEGY:
- 3-4 candidates: MODERATE generalization (keep some original context, replace names/places with general terms)
- 4-5 candidates: HIGH generalization (replace most specifics with abstract terms)
- 2-3 candidates: VERY HIGH generalization (use highly abstract language, maximum privacy)

### GENERALIZATION RULES:
- Replace specific names with: "an individual", "a person", "someone", "a professional", "a public figure", "a notable figure"
- Replace specific places with: "a city", "a country", "a region", "a location", "a venue", "a place", "an area"
- Replace specific dates with: "recently", "in the past", "during a specific period", "at some point", "on a particular occasion"
- Replace specific events with: "a particular event", "a specific occasion", "a notable incident", "a certain happening"
- Replace organizations with: "a company", "an organization", "an institution", "a corporation", "an entity"

### DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use different sentence structures (active/passive, different word orders)
- Vary vocabulary extensively (synonyms, different expressions)
- Change question formats (direct questions, indirect questions, different question words)
- Use different levels of formality and complexity

### CRITICAL: AVOID TAUTOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
DO NOT create questions that are automatically "yes" or too obvious, such as:
- "Do people from the same place have the same origin?"
- "Is it true that two professionals from the same country share a nationality?"
- "Are the same items in the same location?"
- "Do the same people come from the same place?"

Instead, create questions that:
- Ask about meaningful relationships or characteristics
- Require actual knowledge or investigation to answer
- Maintain the original question's intent while being generalized
- Are genuinely informative and not obvious

### TASK:
Original: {input_sentence}

Output ONLY the 10 paraphrases, one per line, without any formatting, numbering, or bullet points:
