Customer acknowledges that the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee are each a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.\"\n\nThis clause suggests that the contract contains a provision for liquidated damages, specifically the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee, which are deemed to be reasonable approximations of the damages that M&I may suffer in the event of termination. \n\nHowever, the contract also states that these fees are not penalties, but rather a reasonable approximation of the damages that M&I may suffer. This suggests that the parties have attempted to negotiate a mutually agreeable amount for liquidated damages, rather than leaving the amount to be determined by a court.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended that a lawyer review this clause to ensure that it is fair and reasonable, and that it complies with any applicable laws or regulations regarding liquidated damages."
