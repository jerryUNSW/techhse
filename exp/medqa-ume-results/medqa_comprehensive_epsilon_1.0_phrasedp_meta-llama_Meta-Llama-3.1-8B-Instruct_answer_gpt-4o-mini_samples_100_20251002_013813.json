    "question": "A 77-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with the complaints of fever, malaise, and night sweats. She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as \"a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL)\u2013diffuse large B cell variant\". Which of the following risk factors is responsible for this patient\u2019s condition?",
