    "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication.

He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",
