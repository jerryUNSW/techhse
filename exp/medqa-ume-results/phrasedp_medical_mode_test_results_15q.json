After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection.

This is describing a type of *genetic recombination* between viruses.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Recall the mechanisms of viral genetic change.**  \nViruses can change genetically through several mechanisms:  \n- **Antigenic drift**: Point mutations, especially in RNA viruses.  \n- **Antigenic shift**: Reassortment of genome segments between two related viruses infecting the same cell.  \n- **Recombination**: Exchange of genetic material between two viral genomes.  \n- **Phenotypic mixing/pseudotyping**: Exchange of surface proteins without genetic change.\n\nThe question specifically mentions *combination of genetic material* to form a new stable virus \u2192 this points to **reassortment or recombination**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Which viruses can undergo reassortment?**  \nReassortment requires a **segmented genome**. If two related segmented viruses infect the same cell, their genome segments can mix and match, producing a new virus.  \n\nExamples of segmented viruses (mnemonic: BOAR):  \n- **Bunyaviruses**  \n- **Orthomyxoviruses** (e.g., influenza)  \n- **Arenaviruses**  \n- **Reoviruses** (e.g., rotavirus)\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Match to the question.**  \nThe question describes a \"new, stable, viable virus particle\" from two viruses of the same family.
