      "original_question": "During an internal audit of BuildSafe Ltd, it was discovered that the team responsible for asbestos removal had proceeded with the project without drafting a comprehensive safety plan. While the team did carry out a partial risk assessment and communicated some safety measures verbally, these efforts were not documented. Furthermore, there were discrepancies in the records regarding who was responsible for overseeing safety compliance on-site. In light of these findings, how should the relevant regulation be applied to BuildSafe Ltd's actions?",

        "They adhered to all required safety protocols",
        "They breached regulation 327 by omitting a necessary safety plan",
