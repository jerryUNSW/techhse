The union had initially scheduled the distribution to coincide with the start of the campaigning period, but logistical issues led to a delay of several days. While some candidates received their materials on time, others, including the complainant, did not. The union maintains that the delay was minor and did not affect the overall fairness of the election.

During an internal audit, it was discovered that while the subcontractor had safety protocols in place, there were discrepancies in their implementation. Some safety measures were only partially followed, and there was confusion about whether the primary contractor or the subcontractor was responsible for rectifying these issues. Additionally, the construction company's records indicated a lack of clear communication regarding the oversight of the subcontractor's safety compliance, complicating the accountability trail. Given this situation, what is the primary legal concern for the construction company regarding their obligations under workplace safety regulations?",
