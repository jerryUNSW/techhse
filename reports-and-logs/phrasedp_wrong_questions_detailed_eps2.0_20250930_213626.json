He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a \u03b2-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen.
