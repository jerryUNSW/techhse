In the last month, we have made the following progress in our project on privacy guardrails for question answering with large language models.

(1) We evaluated a pipeline where privacy perturbation is applied to user queries before sending them to a remote LLM for reasoning traces, which then guide a local model to generate the final answer. On medical multiple-choice datasets without context, our phrase-wise perturbation method achieved higher accuracy than the token-wise baseline, while the purely remote non-private LLM remained the strongest performer.

(2) We designed a phrase-level local differential privacy mechanism tailored for question answering. Compared with token-level noise, our approach led to more stable reasoning and more consistent option ranking, while preserving calibration quality.

(3) We established an evaluation setting focused on sensitive QA domains, and we are extending experiments to medical short-answer datasets with context while developing metrics such as entity exposure and attack success to quantify the utility–privacy trade-off.
