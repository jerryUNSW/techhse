Medications on Admission included Amiodarone 100 QD, Colace 100 bid, lasix 40mg QD, Glyburide 5mg bid, Plaquenil 200mg bid, Isordil 20mg tid, Lisinopril 20mg QD, Coumadin 5mg 3dys/week, 2.5mg 4dys/week, Norvasc 10mg QD, Neurontin 300mg TID, with APAP prn. An override was added on 10/2/06 by Gerad E. Dancy, PA for POTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION: AMIODARONE HCL & WARFARIN with the reason for override being monitoring. The patient was rehydrated with IVF and PO's were encouraged, holding Glypizide while in house, Novolog sliding scale was started on 1/2, Low dose NPH 6 units BID was started on 1/2, bridged with lovenox and INR therapeutic 1/2 and restarted on home regimen of 5/2.5mg variable dose. Pain was controlled with TYLENOL (ACETAMINOPHEN) 650 MG PO Q4H PRN Pain, Headache. A CT pelvis showed a right adnexal cyst which will need further characterization by US and outpatient follow up. The patient has an extensive cardiac history and the fall is not likely related to a cardiac issue as it appears mechanical, with no syncope, chest pain, etc. She was diagnosed with an NSTEMI with a small TnI leak, likely demand related in the setting of hypovolemia and the fall. Enzymes trended down. She was dry on admission and rehydrated with IVF, PO's encouraged, and became euvolemic by 1/2. Her JVP was up to 12cm, although it was difficult to gauge her volume status due to TR. She had a prolonged QT on admission, on telemetry, of unclear etiology, possibly starvation. This was monitored on telemetry until ROMI and drugs that confound were avoided. The QTc resolved to low 500s and a DDD pacer was functioning with V-pacing at 60bpm.

Medical Example 2:
Context: This 57-year-old female with a distant history of ovarian cancer, rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus erythematosus features, and history of TTP, status post splenectomy, was admitted with fever, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. She was initially given cefuroxime and levofloxacin in the emergency department for a presumed community acquired pneumonia, as well as Lasix. Her medications included diltiazem 240 mg a day, lisinopril 40 mg a day, Naprosyn 500 mg b.i.d., NPH insulin 24 units subcutaneously q.a.m., Entex-LA, and Cardizem-CD 240 mg p.o. q.d. She underwent thoracentesis and multiple bilateral therapeutic pleuracentesis, and was diuresed aggressively with Lasix, with her oxygen requirement being down from initially 5 to 6 liters per nasal cannula prior to discharge. A continuous Doppler wave form was found and she underwent abdominal CT scan, which did not show any evidence of venous or lymphatic obstruction. Initially, she was started on cefuroxime and azithromycin by the General Medicine team, and her Legionella urine antigen became positive and levofloxacin was added given recommendations from the Infectious Disease Service. She was off of O2 except that she had desaturations to 86% with ambulation, therefore, she was discharged home with p.r.n. oxygen, on Lasix 80 mg b.i.d., insulin sliding scale, lisinopril 40 mg a day, and Cardizem-CD 240 mg p.o. q.d. and levofloxacin 500 mg times 14 days. An elevated platelet count up to 800 and an elevated CA-125 level was discussed with her GYN oncologist, and she was to follow-up with her doctor in one week.

Medical Example 5:
Context: Ms. Elter is an 83-year-old Spanish-speaking female with history of CAD, distant three-vessel CABG, CRI, NSTEMI in 4/20 and type II diabetes who presented to the ED with PND, dyspnea on exertion, and chest heaviness with no fevers or chills and no sick contacts, and EMS had given her Lasix and Nitrospray. She was briefly on a nonrebreather mask and responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix, with her potassium level reaching 5.8 and Kayexalate administered. Her medications included aspirin, metoprolol, allopurinol, valsartan, glipizide, Lipitor, and nifedipine, with her oxygen saturation eventually reaching the high 90s on a couple of liters of oxygen and her chest x-ray full set negative. She was treated with aspirin, beta-blockers, and statin for coronary artery disease, experienced a CHF flare with an elevated BNP which was managed with Lasix and Diuril, and her after load was reduced with ARB and her previous home calcium channel blocker was weaned off. She had a transient new atrial fibrillation and ventricular ectopy which resolved spontaneously, and was placed on humidified room air with nasal saline sprays and Afrin due to her coronary artery disease. She was transfused a total of 3 units to keep her hematocrit greater than 30 and Coumadin was initially started given her new onset of atrial fibrillation, but ultimately only aspirin was given after consideration of risks versus benefits. She had some constipation which was relieved with stool softeners and the patient received a PPI. Her DM-2 was managed with regular sliding scale insulin with good blood sugar control and her glipizide was held given her worsening creatinine clearance, and her allopurinol was changed to q.72h. from q.o.d. due to the creatinine clearance and she had some left heel and foot pain thought to be secondary to gout, which improved at the time of discharge. Her hematocrit dropped from 29 to 25, her guaiac was negative on the 3/20/04, and she was sent home with VNA support to follow up on her weights and fluid status and with home physical therapy. Her medications at the time of discharge included Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q.d., Metoprolol sustained release 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. for constipation, Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.72h., Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., and Valsartan 160 mg p.o. q.d.

She had been diuresed with a Lasix drip at 10 mg per hour and Zaroxolyn at 2.5 mg p.o. daily, and her Lopressor was held for a decompensated heart failure. She was then started on amiodarone and Coumadin for a new paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her Lasix drip was increased to 20 mg per hour and the Zaroxolyn was increased to b.i.d. After transition from Zaroxolyn to Diuril, which was given 250 mg IV b.i.d., she was prescribed Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. anxiety, Folate 1 mg p.o. daily, Lipitor 80 mg p.o. at bedtime, Lantus 18 units subcutaneously nightly, Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Procrit 40,000 units subcutaneously every other week, Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. chest pain, Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Vitamin B12 subcutaneous injections at clinic, Iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d., Metolazone p.r.n., Multivitamin one tablet p.o. daily, Torsemide 100 mg q.a.m. and 50 mg q.p.m., Coumadin 1 mg q.p.m., and Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily. Despite the dose of Coumadin being decreased from her home dose of 1 mg q.p.m. to a 0.5 mg q.p.m., her INR continued to rise greater than 200. She was started on q.a.c. NovoLog regimen with her Lantus insulin dose decreased from 18 units to 16 units and the NovoLog sliding scale was started. She was monitored on telemetry with no other events and required repletion of both potassium and magnesium despite her renal insufficiency throughout the admission in the setting of injected insulin in the setting of worsening renal failure, so, studies were also normal. She was continued on Aranesp through the admission and was discharged home on a similar regimen to her home regimen simply to Torsemide after the last discharge as her outpatient p.o.

Context: This 57-year-old female with a distant history of ovarian cancer, rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus erythematosus features, and history of TTP, status post splenectomy, was admitted with fever, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. She was initially given cefuroxime and levofloxacin in the emergency department for a presumed community acquired pneumonia, as well as Lasix. Her medications included diltiazem 240 mg a day, lisinopril 40 mg a day, Naprosyn 500 mg b.i.d., NPH insulin 24 units subcutaneously q.a.m., Entex-LA, and Cardizem-CD 240 mg p.o. q.d. She underwent thoracentesis and multiple bilateral therapeutic pleuracentesis, and was diuresed aggressively with Lasix, with her oxygen requirement being down from initially 5 to 6 liters per nasal cannula prior to discharge. A continuous Doppler wave form was found and she underwent abdominal CT scan, which did not show any evidence of venous or lymphatic obstruction. Initially, she was started on cefuroxime and azithromycin by the General Medicine team, and her Legionella urine antigen became positive and levofloxacin was added given recommendations from the Infectious Disease Service. She was off of O2 except that she had desaturations to 86% with ambulation, therefore, she was discharged home with p.r.n. oxygen, on Lasix 80 mg b.i.d., insulin sliding scale, lisinopril 40 mg a day, and Cardizem-CD 240 mg p.o. q.d. and levofloxacin 500 mg times 14 days. An elevated platelet count up to 800 and an elevated CA-125 level was discussed with her GYN oncologist, and she was to follow-up with her doctor in one week.

Context: Ms. Elter is an 83-year-old Spanish-speaking female with history of CAD, distant three-vessel CABG, CRI, NSTEMI in 4/20 and type II diabetes who presented to the ED with PND, dyspnea on exertion, and chest heaviness with no fevers or chills and no sick contacts, and EMS had given her Lasix and Nitrospray. She was briefly on a nonrebreather mask and responded to 80 mg of IV Lasix, with her potassium level reaching 5.8 and Kayexalate administered. Her medications included aspirin, metoprolol, allopurinol, valsartan, glipizide, Lipitor, and nifedipine, with her oxygen saturation eventually reaching the high 90s on a couple of liters of oxygen and her chest x-ray full set negative. She was treated with aspirin, beta-blockers, and statin for coronary artery disease, experienced a CHF flare with an elevated BNP which was managed with Lasix and Diuril, and her after load was reduced with ARB and her previous home calcium channel blocker was weaned off. She had a transient new atrial fibrillation and ventricular ectopy which resolved spontaneously, and was placed on humidified room air with nasal saline sprays and Afrin due to her coronary artery disease. She was transfused a total of 3 units to keep her hematocrit greater than 30 and Coumadin was initially started given her new onset of atrial fibrillation, but ultimately only aspirin was given after consideration of risks versus benefits. She had some constipation which was relieved with stool softeners and the patient received a PPI. Her DM-2 was managed with regular sliding scale insulin with good blood sugar control and her glipizide was held given her worsening creatinine clearance, and her allopurinol was changed to q.72h. from q.o.d. due to the creatinine clearance and she had some left heel and foot pain thought to be secondary to gout, which improved at the time of discharge. Her hematocrit dropped from 29 to 25, her guaiac was negative on the 3/20/04, and she was sent home with VNA support to follow up on her weights and fluid status and with home physical therapy. Her medications at the time of discharge included Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 80 mg p.o. q.d., Metoprolol sustained release 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. for constipation, Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.72h., Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., and Valsartan 160 mg p.o. q.d.
