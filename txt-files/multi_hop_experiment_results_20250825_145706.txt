To determine if the nationalities of the two filmmakers align, we need to identify who these filmmakers might be based on the descriptions provided.

1. **Modern Horror Filmmaker**: This could refer to a director known for contemporary horror films. Some well-known modern horror filmmakers include:
   - Jordan Peele (American) known for "Get Out" and "Us".
   - Ari Aster (American) known for "Hereditary" and "Midsommar".
   - James Wan (Australian) known for "The Conjuring" series and "Saw".
   - Guillermo del Toro (Mexican) known for "Pan's Labyrinth" and "Crimson Peak".

2. **Campy 1950s Filmmaker**: This description suggests a director known for making films in the 1950s that are considered campy, often characterized by exaggerated style and humor. A prominent figure in this category is:
   - Ed Wood (American), known for films like "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "Glen or Glenda".

Next, we compare the nationalities of the filmmakers identified:

- If we consider Jordan Peele or Ari Aster as the modern horror filmmaker, both are American, aligning with Ed Wood's
